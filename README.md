# form-validator
A pure javascript form validator.

## Installation
- Download `lib/FormValidator.js` or `lib/FormValidator.min.js`.
- Link it in a script tag in your page before the script initializing it

The library has not been tested as a component and is not published on npm.
However, it was built using webpack with UMD as target, so it can probably be used as one.

## Documentation
The documentation can be found in `doc/index.html`
