# form-validator
A pure javascript form validator.

## Abandoned because useless with HTML5
While documenting myself on how to do the best validator possible,
I found out it was really useless with all HTML5 properties.
If you have no idea of what I'm talking about,
go see [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation) (and explore the area) to get more information.

(Anyway, maybe I'll continue coding this, just for fun, so go see _dev_ branch if you're interested in :-D)
